# CyberSquad

Git/GitHub Good Practice:
  - start by pulling from the repo either when you start on a new part of the project or when you start your workday.
    - this will update your local repo and keep people working on the same project
  - If you have a merge conflict, Send a message on slack addressing who do you share a merge conflict with and discuss on how to solve it
    - *merge conflict: when 2 or more people have made changes on the same part of the project, since GitHub doesn't know which one to keep, it'll notify whoever is trying to merge that they have a merge conflict.*
    - *merge: when you push your changes back to the repo so that every member of the team has the most up to date version of the project*
  - Make sure that every time you submit a commit, that all parts of your code are working correctly.
    - commits are a good tracking point, think of it as a save file that you can go back to => if you create a save file where there is a bunch of errors than more time will be spent on trying to identify or fix those errors/bugs instead of completign the actual project
  - Create descriptive naming convention for your commit
    - there is nothing more annoying than looking into a commit history and see "some changes" and there is a lot of changes
    - again commits are a good way to go back to and refer to progress, a vague commit description delay progress
  - If you make a significant changes to your code or if you created any commits during the day, you should push your code
    - pushing allows members of the team to get access to progress if you make significant changes it's best to let the team know and allow them to get access
    - Before you leave for the day, if you made any commits for the day make sure to push those so that the rest of team can stay on top of everyone's progress and be aware of potential problem if there is any.


Slack Step:
  - Check your email for an Invitation for slack
  - create an account
  -  join https://cybersquad-workspace.slack.com if it asks you for which workspace, send a hello message in #general

  *NOTE: We're only going to use slack because it's really easy to share files on there and thus anything that we're going to work on can be sent without any third party and can be searched easily
